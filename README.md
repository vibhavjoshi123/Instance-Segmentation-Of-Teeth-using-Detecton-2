Instance Segmentation Of Teeth using Detecton 2

Used custom dataset of laptops and labelled them and drew mask on them using labelling software
converted them to json and split them in train and test dataset
Converted them to COCO dataset format using script to convert them
Using google colab registered them with COCO dataset
Using Detectron 2(open source library )performed transfer learning to train model on custom dataset for mask of teeth
Using test dataset we tested our model to draw mask and it performed very well for mask on teeth
